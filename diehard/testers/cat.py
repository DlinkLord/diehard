    """
    Basic idea is if a monkey typed randomly, how long would it take for it
    to write `CAT`. Practically, we are mapping generated numbers onto the
    alphabet.

    >"There are 26**3 = 17 576 possible 3-letter words, so the average number of
    keystrokes necessary to produce CAT should be around 17 576" [1]

    Example
    ------- 
    

    Parameters
    ----------
    word: string or list-type object
        All elements of the string must be the same number of characters
    match: string or list-type object
        The keyword to search for. Other than length, doesn't really matter.
        If you pass in a list of strings, it will give you a result for each
        passed in string.
    upper_bound: int (optional)
        Upper bound of random values. If not set, will calculate the minimum
        value from the array passed.
    lower_bound: int (optional)
        Lower bound of random values. If not set, will calculate the maximum
        value from the array passed.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Key is the string passed into match, the value is a list of the
        iteration cycles it was found at
